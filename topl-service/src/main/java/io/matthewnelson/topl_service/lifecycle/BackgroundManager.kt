/**
 * When your application is sent to the background (the Recent App's tray or lock screen), the
 * chosen [BackgroundManager.Builder.Policy] will be triggered.
 *
 * Additionally, there are 2 values for you to query if needed to give you context surrounding
 * your application's background state; [taskIsInForeground] and [taskIsRemovedFromRecentApps].
 *
 * If brought back into the foreground by the user:
 *
 *   - **Before Policy execution**: Execution is canceled. If [BaseService.lastAcceptedServiceAction]
 *   was **not** [ServiceActionName.STOP], a startService call is made to ensure it's
 *   started.
 *
 *   - **After Policy execution**: If [BaseService.lastAcceptedServiceAction] was **not**
 *   [ServiceActionName.STOP], a startService call is made to ensure it's started.
 *
 *   - See [io.matthewnelson.topl_service.service.components.binding.BaseServiceBinder],
 *   [BaseService.updateLastAcceptedServiceAction], and [TorService.onTaskRemoved] for
 *   more information.
 *
 * While your application is in the foreground the only way to stop the service is by
 * calling [io.matthewnelson.topl_service.TorServiceController.stopTor], or via the
 * [io.matthewnelson.topl_service.notification.ServiceNotification] Action (if enabled);
 * The OS will not kill a service started using `Context.startService` &
 * `Context.bindService` (how [TorService] is started) while in the foreground.
 *
 * When the user sends your application to the Recent App's tray though, to recoup resources
 * the OS will kill your app after being idle for a period of time (random AF... typically
 * 0.75m to 1.25m if the device's memory is being used heavily) if the service is not moved to
 * the Foreground to inhibit this. This is not an issue if the user removes the task before the
 * OS kills the app, as Tor will be able to shutdown properly and the service will stop.
 *
 * This is where Services get sketchy (especially when trying to implement an always
 * running service for networking), and is the purpose of the [BackgroundManager] class.
 *
 * This class starts your chosen [BackgroundManager.Builder.Policy] as soon as your
 * application is sent to the background. It facilitates a more declarative, flexible
 * operation to fit Library users' needs.
 *
 * See the [BackgroundManager.Builder] for more detail.
 *
 * @param [policy] The chosen [BackgroundPolicy] to be executed.
 * @param [executionDelay] Length of time before the policy gets executed *after* the application
 *   is sent to the background.
 * @param [serviceClass] The Service class being managed
 * @param [bindServiceFlag] The flag to be used when binding to the service
 * @see [io.matthewnelson.topl_service.service.components.binding.BaseServiceBinder.executeBackgroundPolicyJob]
 * @see [io.matthewnelson.topl_service.service.components.binding.BaseServiceBinder.cancelExecuteBackgroundPolicyJob]

         *   killed like one would expect, thus not going through `Application.onCreate` if the
         *   user re-launches your application.
         *   - In the event of being re-launched in the aforementioned state,
         *   [applicationMovedToForeground] is called and Tor will be started again to match the
         *   Service's State for which it was left, prior to "terminating" your application.
         *   - Even while the Service has been properly stopped and everything cleaned up, your
         *   application will continue running and not be killed (Again, Service APIs...).
         *   - If [TorService] is stopped, and *then* your application is cleared from the
         *   recent apps tray, your application will be killed.
         *
         * @param [killAppIfTaskIsRemoved] If set to `true`, your Application's Process will be
         *   killed in [TorService.onDestroy] if the user removed the task from the recent app's
         *   tray and has not returned to the application before [killAppProcess] is called.
