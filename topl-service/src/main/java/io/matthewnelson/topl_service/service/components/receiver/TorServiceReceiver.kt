*     "The Interfaces" is henceforth defined as Application Programming Interfaces

*          - All Classes/methods/variables
*
*      - From the `topl-service-base` module:
*          - All Classes/methods/variables
*
*      - From the `topl-service` module:
*          - The TorServiceController class and it's contained classes/methods/variables
*          - The ServiceNotification.Builder class and it's contained classes/methods/variables
*          - The BackgroundManager.Builder class and it's contained classes/methods/variables
*          - The BackgroundManager.Companion class and it's contained methods/variables
*
*     The following code is excluded from "The Interfaces":

*       - All other code
*
*     Linking TorOnionProxyLibrary-Android statically or dynamically with other
